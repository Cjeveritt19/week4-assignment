I have completed all the requirements apart from the a working GET API to show the client data. I honestly struggled alot with this task i just couldnt figure out the right code for this.

Can I please recieve feedback on the server and client files please.

I struggled in regards to my server file being set up properly due to a Internal server error.I solved this with Manny, I had to change my connection string and add the password in again. I also struggled with setting up my GET API route. I have resolved this by alot of googling, asking others and a lot of looking at different code.

Overall I think this may be my best assignment yet I am pleased with how it has come out.
